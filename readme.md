## *Journal of Macroeconomics*, 2017

### General Info

This repository consists of 15 files -- 9 Stata do files and 6 Stata data files.  In order for the simulation to run, all files must be put in the same working directory.  When the simulation is run, an output file called montecarloresults.dta will be created.  Running the simulation will also create a few extra files in the directory, which can be deleted as needed once the relevant information has been extracted.

### Changing parameters

The "main" program file is MCprogram.do.  All of the parameters that vary in the published paper can be changed in the first 53 lines of code in this file.  The parameters that can be changed are:
